# Algorithms description :  
## ➡️ Ceaser algorithm ⬅️

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.

## ➡️ Monoalphabetic algorithm ⬅️

Monoalphabetic Cipher is a cipher where the letters of the plain text are mapped to ciphertext letters based on a single alphabetic key. It is a one to one mapping.
